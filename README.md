! Important! To see the plots in Binder we recommend switching from Jupyter Lab to Jupyter Notebook. For this after clicking on the Binder logo and waiting until it's loaded in the url path like `https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/julias92-proteomicsvisualization-wy6w5r99/lab` change the `lab` to `tree`, e.g. `https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/julias92-proteomicsvisualization-wy6w5r99/tree`.
